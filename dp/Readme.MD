### Dynamic Programming 
Dynamic programming is an algorithm design method, it's very suitable for optimization problems, 
such as maximum minimum and shortest path etc. 

Using dynamic programming can dramatically lower the time complexity of the algorithms above. 

#### Two methods:
###### Top Down (memo) 
this method cache previous result for using later.
###### Bottom Up
this method solve small problems first, and then combine them together.
###### typical applications
